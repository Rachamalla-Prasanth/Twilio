# Twilio
Twilio Integration with Spring Boot
This is a sample Spring Boot project that demonstrates how to integrate Twilio, a cloud-based communications platform, with a Spring Boot application for sending SMS messages, redirecting phone calls, and playing voice messages.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following:
A Twilio account with API key and secret
Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later installed on your system
Spring Boot version 2.5.0 or later installed on your system
Apache Maven build tool installed on your system

Setup
To set up the project, follow these steps:

Clone the project from the GitHub repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
Open the project in Eclipse or your preferred IDE.

Add the following dependencies to your pom.xml file:

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.twilio.sdk</groupId>
    <artifactId>twilio</artifactId>
    <version>8.8.0</version>
</dependency>

Create a new file called application.properties in the src/main/resources folder, and add the following lines to it, replacing your-account-sid and your-auth-token with your Twilio API key and secret:
twilio.account.sid=your-account-sid
twilio.auth.token=your-auth-token
twilio.phone.number=your-twilio-phone-number

Save the application.properties file
